### Task 7

#### SPECKit Plus

SPECKit Plus is a cutting-edge AI prompting framework that improves collaboration between developers and coding agents such as Claude Code and Gemini CLI. It follows Specification-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence (SDD-RI), a methodology that ensures that AI-generated code adheres to project standards

##### /constitution

The constitution document defines the non-negotiable, guiding principles that all subsequent specifications, plans, and code must adhere to. It serves as the project's foundational rulebook and reusable intelligence artifact.

##### /specify

Specify Here you write clear, structured requirements for each feature. You explain what the feature must achieve, how it should behave, and what the user expects. This becomes the main guide for the AI when generating the code

##### /plan

In the Plan, you convert the clear requirements into a technical plan. You choose the tools, libraries, and structure needed to build the feature

##### /tasks

By now we have a solid plan, now we will break down that plan into small micro tasks.

##### /implement

Now tasks are ready to be implemented by using this command. We will implement the tasks, and the Agent will start the implementation.
